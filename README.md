# Pedestrian-Behavior

A major dilemma faced by autonomous cars is understanding the intention of other road users and communicating with them.


To investigate one aspect of this, specifically pedestrian crossing behavior, we shall analyze a large dataset of pedestrian samples at crosswalks under various conditions (e.g., weather, time of the day) and in different types of roads.


Using the data, we shall analyze pedestrian behavior from two different perspectives: the way they communicate with drivers prior to crossing and the factors that influence their behavior.

It is observed that a change in head orientation in the form of looking or glancing at the traffic is a strong indicator of crossing intention.


Our project aims to aid the interaction between the autonomous vehicles and the pedestrians. Overall, our work formulates the problem of pedestrian-driver interaction and sheds light on its complexity in typical traffic scenarios.
